# c programs  
This repository contains basic C programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts in C programming. These programs are ideal for beginners to understand operators, data types, and simple conditional logic.
| Filename                           | Concept Demonstrated           | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arithmetic_operators.c`           | Arithmetic Operators           | Demonstrates `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` operations, integer vs float division, and type casting. |
| `relational_operators.c`           | Relational Operators           | Shows `>`, `<`, `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=` operators and expression comparison.                   |
| `assignment_operators.c`           | Assignment Operators           | Demonstrates `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` operators and how variables are updated.       |
| `conditional_operator.c`           | Conditional (Ternary) Operator | Uses `? :` to make decisions and assign values based on conditions.                           |
| `conditional_operator_pass_fail.c` | Conditional Operator Example   | Checks if marks are PASS or FAIL using ternary operator.                                      |
| `biggest_of_two.c`                 | Conditional Operator Example   | Finds the bigger of two numbers using the ternary operator.                                   |
| `variable_bytes.c`                 | Data Types & Size              | Demonstrates the number of bytes used by different C data types.                              |
| `overflow_underflow.c`             | Variable Limits                | Shows what happens when assigning values beyond the min/max of `short int` and `int`.         |

 # Key Concepts Covered

1.)Arithmetic Operators: Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

2.)Relational Operators: Comparing values and evaluating expressions (>, <, ==, etc.).

3.)Assignment Operators: Shorthand operators to update variables (+=, -=, etc.).

4.)Conditional (Ternary) Operator: Compact if-else logic for decision-making.

5.)Data Types & Sizes: Understanding memory usage of different types (int, float, char, etc.).

6.)Overflow & Underflow: Demonstrating what happens when a value exceeds the limits of a variable.
